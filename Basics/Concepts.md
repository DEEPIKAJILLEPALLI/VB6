###### Creating New Project
```
1. Run VB6 IDE,You can choose to either start a new project, open an existing project or  
select a list of recently opened programs.
2.Here,we will concentrate on creating new .exe(Executable program),when you open new Standard Exe.  
It consists of the toolbox, the form, the project explorer and the properties window.
3.The Form is the primary building block of a Visual Basic 6 application.
4.It's a good Practice to save your Project first,so that we may not loose our changes  
(if in case system shutdown suddenly due to power issue or somethging like that!).  
save the project by selecting Save Project from the File menu, assign a name to your project  
and save it in a certain folder
